Hiring Manager ,Endava Corp.

**Application for System Administrator Position - Andrei Gultur**

Dear [Mr./Ms./Mx. other],

I am writing with great enthusiasm to apply for the System Administrator position at Endava, which I saw advertised on job-site application. With over two years of hands-on experience in managing complex server infrastructures, configuring secure networks, and providing robust IT support, I am confident that I possess the technical skills and proactive mindset needed to excel in this role and contribute to your team's success.

Your job description emphasizes the need for expertise in **Linux administration and network security**, which are core strengths of mine. In my previous role as a Linux System Administrator at Unifun, I was tasked with maintaining the stability of multiple Ubuntu and Debian servers. By developing and implementing automated Bash scripts for system monitoring and maintenance via Cron, I **reduced manual workload by approximately 15% and proactively prevented potential server outages**, ensuring consistent uptime and performance. I am eager to bring this same focus on efficiency and reliability to your environment.

Furthermore, my freelance work has honed my skills in end-to-end project management. I single-handedly configured, secured, and maintained the network for a Minecraft server with a peak user base of over 100 players. This involved implementing DDoS protection, managing complex firewall rules, and establishing reliable backup systems—directly ensuring service continuity and a positive user experience. This practical experience, combined with my foundational knowledge of Cisco and MikroTik systems from my time at Meganet, has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of what it takes to keep critical infrastructure secure and operational.

I am impressed by Endava's commitment to monopoling the Republic of Moldova, and I am very interested in the opportunity to contribute my skills. Thank you for considering my application. My attached CV provides further detail on my qualifications and experience.

I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can support the goals of Endava in an interview.

Sincerely,  
**Andrei Gultur**
